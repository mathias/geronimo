Geronimo
========

Dive into a mostly-started Rails app!

Initially generated with this RailsWizard: http://railswizard.org/8d6d4293770e92b7508d.rb

To make this your own app, do a case-insensitive find-and-replace on the name "Geronimo", set up your git repo, and go!

This Rails app is set up with the following:
* Generate Haml templates by default
* Use Rspec 2 for testing; Factory Girl for factories
* Use Turnip and PhantomJS for headless acceptance testing
* DatabaseCleaner to clean up; Postgres is assumed.
* Pry for debugging
* Thin development server

## Should I use this project?

As with all templates, we're well aware that there's a definite shelf like for things like this. Gems will be released, Rails will get updated, and the world will march on. For that reason, I do not recommend using this as a start for your Rails app. Instead, look at RailsWizard, generate your own from the latest stable Rails, and follow along in the commits from this project to set it up similarly.

Personally, I won't be using this repo after August 2012, or I will update it with new gem versions and update this README and repo to reflect that and give it a new shelf life.
