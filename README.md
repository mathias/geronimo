Geronimo
========

Dive into a mostly-started Rails app!

Initially generated with this RailsWizard: http://railswizard.org/8d6d4293770e92b7508d.rb

To make this your own app, do a case-insensitive find-and-replace on the name "Geronimo", set up your git repo, and go!

This Rails app is set up with the following:
* Generate Haml templates by default
* Use Rspec 2 for testing; Factory Girl for factories
* Use Turnip and PhantomJS for headless acceptance testing
* DatabaseCleaner to clean up; Postgres is assumed.
* Pry for debugging
* Thin development server
